This is the readme for the models associated with the paper:

Raudies F, Zilli EA, Hasselmo ME (2014) Deep belief networks learn
context dependent behavior. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0093250">PLoS One</a> 9:e93250

This code was contributed by Florian Raudies. Note that the code is
also available at the journal web site
<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0093250#s5">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0093250#s5</a>

This directory contains Matlab (R) code to replicate the figures and
simulations from the paper.

Note the approximate length of time that it takes the scripts to run
is included in the comments at the top of the scripts as revealed by
this grep command:

$ grep min Fig*.m | grep about | grep \%
Figure2.m:%   This script will run for about 2 minutes.
Figure3A.m:%   This script will run for about 45 minutes.
Figure3B.m:%   This script will run for about 620 minutes or 10 hours.
Figure3C.m:%   This script will run for about 50 minutes.
Figure3D.m:%   This script will run for about 40 minutes.
Figure3E.m:%   This script will run for about 500 minutes or 8 hours.
Figure3F.m:%   This script will run for about 45 minutes.
Figure3G.m:%   This script will run for about 35 minutes.
Figure3H.m:%   This script will run for about 35 minutes.
Figure4B.m:%   This script will run for about 80 minutes.
Figure4C.m:%   This script will run for about 1,100 minutes or 16 hours.
Figure4D.m:%   This script will run for about 40 minutes.

Entering Figure2 on the matlab command prompt for example generates
the following figures:

Figure 2B

<img src="./screenshots/figure2c.png" alt="fig 2c" width="550">
Figure 2C

<img src="./screenshots/figure2d.png" alt="fig 2d" width="550">
Figure 2D

<img src="./screenshots/figure2e.png" alt="fig 2e" width="550">
