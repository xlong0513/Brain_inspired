Raudies F, Hasselmo ME (2014) A model of hippocampal spiking responses
to items during learning of a context-dependent task.

This code was contributed by Florian Raudies. Note that the code is
also available at the journal web site
<a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/file/downloadfile/150379/octet-stream/Data%20Sheet%201.ZIP/5/1/108378">http://journal.frontiersin.org/file/downloadfile/150379/octet-stream/Data%20Sheet%201.ZIP/5/1/108378</a>

This directory contains Matlab (R) code to simulate a small hippocampal
network that learns a context-dependent task.

To reproduce the panels of the figures in the article use the scripts
'Figure3AAndFigure4.m' and 'Figure3BAndFigure5.m'.

For example running Figure3AAndFigure4 by entering that name on the
matlab command prompt, after a few minutes yields:

<img src="./screenshots/fig4a.png" alt="fig 4a" width="550">

<img src="./screenshots/fig4b.png" alt="fig 4b" width="550">
Fig 4B

<img src="./screenshots/fig4c.png" alt="fig 4c" width="550">
Fig 4C

<img src="./screenshots/fig4d.png" alt="fig 4d" width="550">
Fig 4D
