This is the model associated with the paper:

Shanahan M (2008) A spiking neuron model of cortical broadcast and
competition. Conscious Cogn 17:288-303

These model files were supplied by Dr Shanahan.

Usage:
At the matlab prompt type GWTrials to start the top-level program.
This will run for a little under 4 hours generating figures in 13
training with several trials per session.  These figures are similar
to those in figures 7, 8, and 9 in the paper:

The code contains some corrections, so doesn't reproduce the exact 
figures from the paper, although they are qualitatively the same.
