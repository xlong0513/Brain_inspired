<html><pre>This folder contains Matlab code related to 

Tripp BP & Eliasmith C, 2007, Neural populations can induce reliable
post-synaptic currents without observable spike rate changes or 
precise spike timing. 

The code is organized into the following sub-folders: 

  exp: scripts for running numerical experiments
  fig: scripts for producing article figures 
  lib: library functions that are called by the above scripts

Note that some of the figure scripts require data files that are
produced by the experiment scripts. 

This code has been tested with Matlab versions 6.5, 7.0.1, and
partially tested in 7.8.0.

Usage:
Download and extract this archive.  After starting matlab add 
the lib folder to the path
addpath(path, '(where you put it)\lib`)
then cd to the fig folder and type a figure file, for example,
figure1
to start execution.
This first one generates figure 1a, 1b, and 1c:
<img src="./screenshot1a.jpg" alt="fig 1a">
<img src="./screenshot1b.jpg" alt="fig 1b">
<img src="./screenshot1c.jpg" alt="fig 1c">
